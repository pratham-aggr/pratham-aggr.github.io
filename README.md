# `Hello World!` üëã  

I'm a **Data Science** student at the **University of California San Diego** üî±, currently diving deep into the art and science of turning data into impactful insights. I love exploring the intersection of technology, research, and creativity to solve complex problems and build meaningful projects.  

## Experience

### [**Rebooting Friends: A Data-Driven Blueprint for the Ultimate Reboot** ](https://pratham-aggr.github.io/Rebooting-Friends/)
   - Conducted data analysis and statistical testing (bootstrapping, hypothesis testing) to assess the impact of directors and romantic relationships on Friends episode ratings and viewership, driving insights for a potential reboot strategy.
   - Applied sentiment analysis and Bayesian modeling to map character emotions and dynamics, informing character development and enhancing storylines for the reboot.
  - Developed a linear regression model to recommend an optimal episode count (80 episodes) for the reboot, maximizing viewer engagement and retention based on historical trends.
   - **Skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Bootstrapping, Confidence Interval Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Regression, Probability Analysis, Bayes' Theorem Application, and N-grams Analysis.

### [**TSwift Tunes: Data-Driven Insights and Recommender Systems**](https://pratham-aggr.github.io/TSwift-Tunes/)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Taylor Swift's discography to uncover trends, visualize audio feature relationships, analyze sentiment, and compare collaborative vs. solo tracks.
- Built a song recommender system to suggest similar tracks based on user preferences & audio features
- Created a TF-IDF-based lyrics search tool and keyword extraction feature to analyze and summarize song themes, focusing on the Lover album.
- **Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), TF-IDF for Text Mining, Song Recommendation System, Sentiment Analysis, Audio Feature Correlation, Keyword Extraction.

### [**Predictive Modeling of Heating and Cooling Loads**](https://pratham-aggr.github.io/Energy-Efficiency/)
- Developed a predictive model using a dataset from UCI to forecast heating and cooling loads based on factors such as glazing area distribution and orientation.
- Applied unsupervised clustering (e.g., K-means) to segment the data, improving the regression model's performance by capturing underlying patterns.
- Employed a multidimensional linear regression model, achieving 91% accuracy in predicting energy loads, optimizing building energy efficiency predictions.
- **Skills**: Data Preprocessing, Regression Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning
